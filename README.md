# GoShark

## About

GoLang based Wireless Network Analysis tool. This tool is designed to be a simple, easy to use, and fast wireless network analysis tool. It is designed to be used by network administrators, security professionals, and anyone else who needs to analyze wireless networks.

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
